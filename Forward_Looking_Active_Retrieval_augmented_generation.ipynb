        "There is a lot of cool detail in how the lookup of relevant documents is done. Basically, the tokens that model is uncertain about are highlighted, and then an LLM is called to generate a question that would lead to that answer. For example, if the generated text is Joe Biden went to Harvard, and the tokens the model was uncertain about was Harvard, then a good generated question would be where did Joe Biden go to college. This generated question is then used in a retrieval step to fetch relevant documents.\n",

It is based on the idea that language is the key to intelligence and that a system that can understand and use language at a human level can also exhibit general intelligence.\\n\\nBaby AGI, on the other hand, is a specific AGI project developed by OpenCog Foundation, led by Ben Goertzel.

Approach\\n\\nThe Langchain Framework is a top-down approach to AGI, meaning it starts with a high-level concept of intelligence and works towards creating a system that embodies this concept. In this case, the concept is human-level language understanding and use.\\n\\nBaby AGI, on the other hand, is a bottom-up approach, inspired by the'"
